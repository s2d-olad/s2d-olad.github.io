### Breakout sessions: 

In an attempt to get some of the benefits of an in-person workshop, there will be a virtual breakout session in gather town before lunch. In addition to the poster room, we have three rooms, number 1 - 3. With your help, we will assign topics to each of these rooms. Please choose a room with a topic that you are interested in and join the virtual discussion during the breakout session. We hope these rooms will provide a great venue to meet researchers with shared interests, share research ideas and develop new collaboration Please suggest topics for the breakout rooms in Rocket Chat. If we have many suggestions, we will take a poll to select the three topics with the greatest amount of interest. The link to our polling site is above and will be shared on Rocket Chat

### Virtual Networking and small group meetings:  

We encourage you to mingle, network, discuss topics of interest, and form small group meetings during lunch and throughout the day. You can meet with people in the workshop gather town at any time during the day.
